There is a significant volume of population living in slums / Bastis in every city / town. Falling on the bottom most level of economic pyramid, these people may not have access to regular food or even a shelter, forced to survive on limited food & live in makeshift temporary sheds made from whatever is available. Pandemic has made their lives even more difficult and have been the worst hit. We, a small group of individuals, who are slightly better off and keen to help with whatever is possible from our own resources, supplementing with the donations from those who wish to contribute to this effort of ours. We feel privileged to extend our helping hand to this small percentage of this population.";
